About me
Greetings! I am currently a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate at the [School of Computing and Information Systems](https://computing.smu.edu.sg/), My research interests include Multi-armed Bandits, Reinforcement Learning, Optimization, RLHF, and Generative Models. My primary objective is to develop robust models that consider real-world constraints, thereby facilitating efficient decision-making in environments with limited resources. Currently, I am particularly enthusiastic about the exploration and understanding of the Large Language Model’s immense potential in a wide range of practical applications.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Pradeep VARAKANTHAM](http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/pradeepv/) of [CARE.AI Lab](https://care-ai.smu.edu.sg/) from the School of Computing and Information Systems, SMU.

You can find my CV here: [Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Resume_dexun.pdf). I'm actively seeking new job opportunities and I appreciate you taking the time to visit my personal homepage. Feel free to reach out to me!
